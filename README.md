It’s very lean and minimalistic one page app with CSV download option. I made it to solve two problems:

1. Create multiple tagged links for one URL without repeating myself dozens of times
2. Reduce typos while entering UTM tags by hand

Main differences from other builders are:

1. Bunch of pre-made tags you can choose by clicking on a button instead of manually typing values into input fields
2. It shows multiple tagged URLs for many sources at once, so you don’t have to repeat yourself for every source/medium
3. Remembers your previous settings for following visits (localStorage)
4. Tagged URLs can be downloaded as CSV file
5. Designed to be ultra quick: one page, no animations, no loading, no “next” buttons, updates in real-time
